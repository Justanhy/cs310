The ristretto255 group can be implemented using Curve25519, allowing existing Curve25519 implementations to be reused and extended to provide a prime-order group. Likewise, the decaf448 group can be implemented using edwards448.},

   abstract = {The normal form x2 + y2 = a2+a 2x2y2 for elliptic curves simplifies formulas in the theory of elliptic curves and functions. Its principal advantage is that it allows the addition law, the group law on the elliptic curve, to be stated explicitly X = 1/a · xy′+x′y/1+xyx′y′, Y = 1/a · yy′-xx′/1-xyx′y′. The j-invariant of an elliptic curve determines 24 values of a for which the curve is equivalent to x2 + y2 = a2 + a2x2y 2, namely, the roots of (x8 + 14x4 + 1) 3 - j/16(x5 - x)4. The symmetry in x and y implies that the two transcendental functions x(t) and y(t) that parameterize x2 + y2 = a2 + a2x2y 2 in a natural way are essentially the same function, just as the parameterizing functions sin t and cos t of the circle are essentially the same function. Such a parameterizing function is given explicitly by a quotient of two simple theta series depending on a parameter τ in the upper half plane. © 2007 American Mathematical Society.},

    abstract = {The literature proposes many software metrics for evaluating the source code non-functional properties, such as its complexity and maintainability. The literature also proposes several tools to compute those properties on source codes developed with many different software languages. However, the Rust language emergence has not been paired by the community’s effort in developing parsers and tools able to compute metrics for the Rust source code. Also, metrics tools often fall short in providing immediate means of comparing maintainability metrics between different algorithms or coding languages. We hence introduce rust-code-analysis, a Rust library that allows the extraction of a set of eleven maintainability metrics for ten different languages, including Rust. rust-code-analysis, through the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a source file, allows the inspection of the code structure, analyzing source code metrics at different levels of granularity, and finding code syntax errors before compiling time. The tool also offers a command-line interface that allows exporting the results in different formats. The possibility of analyzing source codes written in different programming languages enables simple and systematic comparisons between the metrics produced from different empirical and large-scale analysis sources.}
