issn = {1081-6011},
pages = {459-474},
abstract = {Bit coin is the first digital currency to see widespread adoption. While payments are conducted between pseudonyms, Bit coin cannot offer strong privacy guarantees: payment transactions are recorded in a public decentralized ledger, from which much information can be deduced. Zero coin (Miers et al., IEEE S&amp;P 2013) tackles some of these privacy issues by unlinking transactions from the payment&#x27;s origin. Yet, it still reveals payments&#x27; destinations and amounts, and is limited in functionality. In this paper, we construct a full-fledged ledger-based digital currency with strong privacy guarantees. Our results leverage recent advances in zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs). First, we formulate and construct decentralized anonymous payment schemes (DAP schemes). A DAP scheme enables users to directly pay each other privately: the corresponding transaction hides the payment&#x27;s origin, destination, and transferred amount. We provide formal definitions and proofs of the construction&#x27;s security. Second, we build Zero cash, a practical instantiation of our DAP scheme construction. In Zero cash, transactions are less than 1 kB and take under 6 ms to verify - orders of magnitude more efficient than the less-anonymous Zero coin and competitive with plain Bit coin.},

  abstract = {The literature proposes many software metrics for evaluating the source code non-functional properties, such as its complexity and maintainability. The literature also proposes several tools to compute those properties on source codes developed with many different software languages. However, the Rust language emergence has not been paired by the community’s effort in developing parsers and tools able to compute metrics for the Rust source code. Also, metrics tools often fall short in providing immediate means of comparing maintainability metrics between different algorithms or coding languages. We hence introduce rust-code-analysis, a Rust library that allows the extraction of a set of eleven maintainability metrics for ten different languages, including Rust. rust-code-analysis, through the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a source file, allows the inspection of the code structure, analyzing source code metrics at different levels of granularity, and finding code syntax errors before compiling time. The tool also offers a command-line interface that allows exporting the results in different formats. The possibility of analyzing source codes written in different programming languages enables simple and systematic comparisons between the metrics produced from different empirical and large-scale analysis sources.}

  abstract  = {Nguyen and Shparlinski have recently presented a polynomial-time algorithm that provably recovers the signer's secret DSA key when a few consecutive bits of the random nonces k (used at each signature generation) are known for a number of DSA signatures at most linear in log q (q denoting as usual the small prime of DSA), under a reasonable assumption on the hash function used in DSA. The number of required bits is about log1/2 q, but can be decreased to log log q with a running time qo(1/loglogq) subexponential in log q, and even further to two in polynomial time if one assumes access to ideal lattice basis reduction, namely an oracle for the lattice closest vector problem for the infinity norm. All previously known results were only heuristic, including those of Howgrave-Graham and Smart who introduced the topic. Here, we obtain similar results for the elliptic curve variant of DSA (ECDSA).},

  abstract = {The normal form x2 + y2 = a2+a 2x2y2 for elliptic curves simplifies formulas in the theory of elliptic curves and functions. Its principal advantage is that it allows the addition law, the group law on the elliptic curve, to be stated explicitly X = 1/a · xy′+x′y/1+xyx′y′, Y = 1/a · yy′-xx′/1-xyx′y′. The j-invariant of an elliptic curve determines 24 values of a for which the curve is equivalent to x2 + y2 = a2 + a2x2y 2, namely, the roots of (x8 + 14x4 + 1) 3 - j/16(x5 - x)4. The symmetry in x and y implies that the two transcendental functions x(t) and y(t) that parameterize x2 + y2 = a2 + a2x2y 2 in a natural way are essentially the same function, just as the parameterizing functions sin t and cos t of the circle are essentially the same function. Such a parameterizing function is given explicitly by a quotient of two simple theta series depending on a parameter τ in the upper half plane. © 2007 American Mathematical Society.},
