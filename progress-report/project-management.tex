Discuss why we change from plan-based to agile development. 

Present timetable/plan for term 2. Mention extension to SNARKS.

Outline risk management plan. Explain why we have not conducted all research necessary, such as for Stacking Sigmas and SNARKS. Explain that Stacking Sigmas is much more complicated and work on CDS is required to familiarise with the cryptographic concepts. Explain that it is an ideal plan that is possible, but there are also likely to be unexpected issues and we have plan B.
