\subsection{Homomorphisms}
A homomorphism between two algebraic objects $A$ and $B$ is a function $f: A \rightarrow B$ which preserves their algebraic structure. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If elements in $A$ satisfy some algebraic equation involving addition or multiplication, their images in $B$ also satisfy the same algebraic equation
    \item The details of the definitions of homomorphisms depend on algebraic structures of $A$ and $B$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{definition}[Group Homomorphisms]
Suppose we have arbitrary groups $A$ and $B$, with the group operators $\circ_A$ and $\circ_B$ respectively. A group homomorphism is a function $f: A \rightarrow B$ such that $f(a_1 \circ_A a_2) = f(a_1) \circ_B f(a_2)$ for all $a_1,a_2 \in A$
