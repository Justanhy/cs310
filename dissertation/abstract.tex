    Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs have been a key focus in a long line of research for many years. In particular, ZK proofs for disjunctive statements have been widely studied, mainly because disjunctive statements occur commonly in practice, making them a core target of research. For example, disjunctive proofs can be used to provide some extent of privacy to a prover, as a verifier cannot determine which clause is being satisfied by the witness (based on some relation). This has a myriad of use cases from membership proofs to proving the existence of a particular transaction (with some id) in a large list of transactions.
    
    This project looks at implementing the ZK protocol outlined by Cramer and Damg{\aa}rd in the paper \textquote{Zero.Knowledge Proofs for Finite Field Arithmetic, or: Can Zero-Knowledge Be for Free?}. We will also seek to improve this implementation based on more recent work by Goel {\em et al.} in \textquote{Stacking Sigmas: A Framework to Compose $\Sigma$-Protocols for Disjunctions}. This will provide a means to compare the practical efficiency of such designs and possibly help to facilitate future improvements.
