\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
Before discussing our implementation and results, we introduce the necessary background concepts for this project. 
We firstly formalise the notation we use in this report, and highlight broad concepts that are relevant to the entire project. 
Afterwhich, we split the remaining section into 3 subsections: 
each for one of the compilers we implement \cite{CDS94, StackingSigmas, SpeedStacking}.

\subsection{Notation}\label{sec:notation}
\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \label{tab:notation}
  \caption{Notation used in this report}
  \begin{tabular}{|A{0.1\linewidth}|M{0.8\linewidth}|}
    \hline
    Symbol & Details \\\hline
    $\lambda$ & Computational security parameter. Refers to a cryptographic system's security 
    against a computationally bounded adversary. \\\hline
    $\kappa$ & Statistical security parameter. Refers to the security provided by negligible statistical probability. \\\hline
    $\verify$ & Boolean assertion. \\\hline
    $\circ$ & Bit concatenation: $0000 \circ 1111 = 00001111$ \\\hline
    $\samplefrom$ & Sampling from a distribution: $x \samplefrom \mathcal D$ is the sampling of "$x$" from 
    the distribution "$\mathcal D$" \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

% We denote by $x \randselect \mathcal D$ the process of sampling "$x$" fro the distribution "$\mathcal D$" using pseudorandom coins derived from a pseudo-random generator (PRG) applied to the seed "$s$".

% CDS %
\subsection{CDS94}
In this section, we introduce the components necessary for the \cite{CDS94} compiler. In addition to a $\Sigma$-protocol, which 
is relevant to every compiler in this project, the CDS94 compiler requires a \emph{secret sharing scheme} and the compiler 
itself. In the following 2 subsections, we introduce these components.

% Stacking Sigmas %
\subsection{Stacking Sigmas}
Moving on, we introduce the concept of a \emph{partially-binding vector commitment scheme} 
and present the Stacking Sigmas compiler proposed by \cite{StackingSigmas}. This compiler aims to improve on the 
communication complexity of the \cite{CDS94} compiler, by reducing the communication size to $O(\log n)$, where $n$ is the 
number of clauses in the disjunction.
