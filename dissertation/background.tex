\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
Before discussing our implementation and results, we introduce the necessary background material for this project. 
We will first formalise the notation we use in this report, and highlight broad concepts that are relevant to the entire project. 
Afterwhich, we split the remaining section into 3 subsections: each for one of the compilers we implement \cite{CDS94, StackingSigmas, SpeedStacking}.

\subsection{Notation}
Throughout this paper, we use $\lambda$ to denote the computational security parameter and $\kappa$ to denote the statistical security parameter. Computational security refers to a cryptographic system's security against a computationally bounded adversary, while statistical security refers to security that is not dependent on the computational power of the adversary but instead on the security that negligible statistical probability provides.

We denote by $x \samplefrom \mathcal D$ the sampling of "$x$" from the distribution "$\mathcal D$", and $\verify$ means a boolean assertion of equality on the left-hand side and right-hand side of the symbol. Additionally, we use $\circ$ to indicate the concatenation of bits ($0000 \circ 1111 = 00001111$).

% We denote by $x \randselect \mathcal D$ the process of sampling "$x$" fro the distribution "$\mathcal D$" using pseudorandom coins derived from a pseudo-random generator (PRG) applied to the seed "$s$".
